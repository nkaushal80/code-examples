To create a rate limit for a Kafka consumer, you can use the max.poll.records and max.poll.interval.ms configuration parameters.

The max.poll.records parameter sets the maximum number of records that a consumer can fetch in a single poll request. This parameter limits the rate at which records are consumed from Kafka. You can set this parameter to a value that suits your application's needs, based on factors such as the size of the records and the processing time required for each record.

The max.poll.interval.ms parameter sets the maximum time that a consumer can spend processing records before it must issue another poll request. This parameter limits the maximum rate at which records can be processed. You can set this parameter to a value that ensures that your application does not exceed the rate limit imposed by the max.poll.records parameter.

For example, to limit the rate at which records are consumed to 100 records per second, you can set max.poll.records to 100 and max.poll.interval.ms to 1000 (since there are 1000 milliseconds in a second). This configuration will ensure that the consumer fetches at most 100 records in each poll request and that it polls for records no more than once per second.

Here's an example configuration for a Kafka consumer that sets these parameters:

javascript
Copy code
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("group.id", "test-group");
props.put("enable.auto.commit", "true");
props.put("auto.commit.interval.ms", "1000");
props.put("max.poll.records", "100");
props.put("max.poll.interval.ms", "1000");

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
In this example, the consumer is configured to limit the rate at which records are consumed to 100 records per second. You can adjust the max.poll.records and max.poll.interval.ms values as needed to achieve the desired rate limit for your application.
